# Final-Project

## Problem
### Antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem and more individuals are predicted to die from antibiotic resistance than cancer in 20250.

## Goal
### Identify and classify antibiotic resistance genes in Klebsiella pneumoniae

## Tool Required
- Comprehensive Antibiotic-Resistant Database (Detect antibiotic resistant genes) 
- FastQC (Read Quality Assesment)
- SPAdes (Genome Assembly)
- Prokka (Bacterial genome annotation
- Kraken2 (Classification of resistance genes)
- MAFFT (Multiple sequence alignment)
- RAxML (Phylogenetic tree)

# We need Jorge's dataset for the Antibiotic resistant genes
